# Phase 3 Completion: Advanced Component System

## Overview

Phase 3 has been successfully completed with the implementation of a comprehensive component system for Stepwise. This includes recursive file execution with the `-r` flag, reduced default timeouts, beautiful loading spinners, and a powerful component import system.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Recursive File Execution (`-r` flag)

**Before:**
- All directory execution was recursive by default
- No control over search depth

**After:**
- Non-recursive execution by default (only files in specified directory)
- `-r` flag enables recursive search through subdirectories
- Better performance and more predictable behavior

**Usage:**
```bash
# Non-recursive (default)
./stepwise run examples/

# Recursive
./stepwise run examples/ -r
```

### 2. Reduced Default Timeouts

**Before:**
- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Long wait times for failed requests

**After:**
- Default timeout: 10 seconds
- Faster failure detection
- Better user experience

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment variable override
export STEPWISE_TIMEOUT=5s
./stepwise run workflow.yml
```

### 3. Beautiful Loading Spinners

**Features:**
- Animated spinners with color cycling
- Automatic detection of CI/non-interactive environments
- Progress indicators for parallel execution
- Success/Error/Info messages with appropriate icons

**Behavior:**
- **Interactive mode**: Full animated spinners
- **CI mode**: Simple text output
- **Non-color mode**: Plain text without colors

**Examples:**
```
⠋ Searching for workflow files...
✓ Found 5 workflow files
⠙ Running workflows: 2/5 completed
✓ All workflows completed successfully
```

### 4. Advanced Component System

#### Component Types

**Step Components:**
```yaml
name: "HTTP GET Step"
version: "1.0"
type: "step"
variables:
  base_url: "https://httpbin.org"
steps:
  - name: "HTTP GET Request"
    request:
      method: "GET"
      url: "{{base_url}}/get"
    validate:
      - status: 200
```

**Group Components:**
```yaml
name: "Authentication Group"
version: "1.0"
type: "group"
variables:
  api_base_url: "https://api.example.com"
steps:
  - name: "Login User"
    request:
      method: "POST"
      url: "{{api_base_url}}/auth/login"
```

**Workflow Components:**
```yaml
name: "API Test Workflow"
version: "1.0"
type: "workflow"
imports:
  - path: "auth-group"
    alias: "Authentication"
steps:
  - name: "Create User"
    request:
      method: "POST"
      url: "{{api_base_url}}/users"
```

#### Import System

**Basic Import:**
```yaml
imports:
  - path: "./components/http-get-step"
    alias: "Get Request"
    variables:
      base_url: "{{base_url}}"
```

**Import with Overrides:**
```yaml
imports:
  - path: "./components/http-post-step"
    alias: "Custom POST"
    variables:
      base_url: "{{base_url}}"
    overrides:
      name: "Custom POST Request"
      request:
        body:
          message: "Hello from Stepwise"
```

#### Advanced Features

**Circular Import Detection:**
- Automatic detection and prevention of circular dependencies
- Clear error messages for circular imports

**Component Caching:**
- Components are cached after loading
- Improved performance for repeated imports

**Variable Inheritance:**
- Variables from imported components merge with parent workflow
- Support for variable overrides during import

**Capture Propagation:**
- Captures from components available in parent workflow
- Support for global captures at component level

## Technical Implementation

### Component Manager

```go
type ComponentManager struct {
    searchPaths []string
    components  map[string]*Component
    loading     map[string]bool // For cycle detection
    mu          sync.RWMutex
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Thread-safe component loading
- Cycle detection with loading state tracking
- Flexible search path configuration
- Component validation and caching

### Spinner System

```go
type Spinner struct {
    colors    *Colors
    frame     int
    message   string
    running   bool
    mu        sync.Mutex
    stopChan  chan bool
    doneChan  chan bool
}
```

**Features:**
- Smooth animation with 100ms intervals
- Color cycling for visual appeal
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- Environment-aware behavior

### Import Resolution

**Process:**
1. Load component from file
2. Resolve imports recursively
3. Apply variable overrides
4. Merge into parent workflow
5. Cache for future use

**Error Handling:**
- Clear error messages for missing components
- Validation of component structure
- Proper cleanup on errors
